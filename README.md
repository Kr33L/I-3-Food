What SHOULD work:
- Signing up
- Logging in 
- Reading and writing to db
- Cookies and sessions

## Setup

Make sure you have Git and Node (v18) installed.

1. Clone this repo and cd into the directory

2. Run `npm install` to install all the dependencies

3. Run `npm run seed` to create the database. Run `npm run seed-win` if using Windows.

4. Run `npm run dev` to start the server. Run `npm run dev-win` if using Windows.

This uses the nodemon library to auto-restart the server when you save changes.

## Testing

**We currently have no tests written**
